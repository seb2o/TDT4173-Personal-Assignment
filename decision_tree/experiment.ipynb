    "For this problem, you will be implementing a Decision Tree classifier that works on discrete (categorical) features. Although a relatively simple learning algorithm, the Decision Tree is often used as a fundamental building block for more powerful (and popular) models such as Random Forest and Gradient Boosted ensembles. \n",
    "\n",
    "You should base your solution on the [ID3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ID3_algorithmhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ID3_algorithm) algorithm. This is a basic tree-learning algorithm that greedly grows a tree based on _information gain_ (reduction in entropy). Please refer to Chapter 3 of _Machine Learning_ by Tom M. Mitchell for more details. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We have provided some skeleton code for the classifier, along with a couple of utility functions in the [decision_tree.py](./decision_tree.py) module. Please fill out the functions marked with `TODO` and feel free to add extra constructor arguments as you see fit (just make sure the default constructor solves the first dataset).\n"

Feel free to add extra functionality to it and/or the data preprocessing pipeline that might improve performance on the validation (and ultimately test set). As a debugging reference; it is highly possible to obtain accuracies over the validation and test set ranging from mid ~80% to low ~90%."
